    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper is one of the first attempt at using touchpad data to predict the user's stress. This project extract muscle stiffness derived from biomechanical models of the user's movement from laptop touchpad operations while preforming predefined tasks to investigate the correlation with the user's stress. I also have a on-going project that uses deeplearning to directly infer user's stress from the trackpad data, therefore, I think it would be helpful if I can replicate their anlaysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the data collection process, which requires the physical presence of the user and expensive equipment, is quite hard to replicate, and the data analysis involves complex operations (deduct parameters from biomechanical models), I will do a replication of the data processing in this paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "###Power Analysis\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.\n",
    "\\\n",
    "###Planned Sample\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.\n",
    "\\\n",
    "###Materials\n",
    "\\\n",
    "All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.\n",
    "-->\n",
    "### Procedure\t\n",
    "\n",
    "I will not replicate this, but this is the procedure the data is gathered in the original paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment contained four distinct phases:\n",
    "+ Relaxation phase - a five minute destressor task designed to normalize the effects of external factors and to destress the participant towards baseline levels\n",
    "+ tRelaxed phase - a ten minute phase taking place immediately after the Relaxation phase. The subject performs a series of computer tasks using the laptop trackpad. Task orders within each category (clicking, dragging, steering) are fully randomized.\n",
    "+ Stressor phase - a five minute stress-inducing task.\n",
    "+ tStressed phase - a ten minute phase taking place immediately after the stressor phase. The subject performs a series of computer tasks using the laptop trackpad. Task orders within each category (clicking, dragging, steering) are fully randomized.\n",
    "To control for order effects, subjects were assigned to one of two orders of the stressed-relaxed task pairs (see Figure 3 ). The experimental groups for each protocol were balanced by gender, with 5 males and 6 females completing each protocol.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Analysis Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "I will start from the raw data collected from each experiment, including the raw trackpad data throughout the whole experiment, and a separate file recording the division of each session in the experiment.\n",
    "The trackpad file contains a time-series data with position, area of contact, the shape of contact of all the fingers in contact with the trackpad at that time.\n",
    "The other file contains the start and end timestamp of each trial and the start and end timestamp of each stressed or not stressed condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will perform all the data segmentation, cleaning to extract a single stream of finger events for each trial.\n",
    "From the finger events, I will perform multiple different analyses as described in the paper.\n",
    "Then I will compare the results of that analysis between different conditions and different experiments.\n",
    "I will perform all the statistical analysis and recreate all the figures in that paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences from Original Study\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no known difference from the original study.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anticipated Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest challenge is that I'm not familar with those biomechnical models, but the programming should be within my capability.\n",
